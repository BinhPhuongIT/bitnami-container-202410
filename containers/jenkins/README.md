# What is Jenkins?

> Jenkins is widely recognized as the most feature-rich CI available with easy configuration, continuous delivery and continuous integration support, easily test, build and stage your app, and more. It supports multiple SCM tools including CVS, Subversion and Git. It can execute Apache Ant and Apache Maven-based projects as well as arbitrary scripts.

# TL;DR;

```bash
$ curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-jenkins/master/docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up
```

# Why use Bitnami Images ?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* Bitnami images are built on CircleCI and automatically pushed to the Docker Hub.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.

# Prerequisites

To run this application you need [Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine) >= `1.10.0`. [Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose) is recommended with a version `1.6.0` or later.

# How to use this image

## Using Docker Compose

The recommended way to run Jenkins is using Docker Compose using the following `docker-compose.yml` template:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  jenkins:
    image: 'bitnami/jenkins:latest'
    ports:
      - '80:8080'
      - '443:8443'
    volumes:
      - 'jenkins_data:/bitnami/jenkins'
volumes:
  jenkins_data:
    driver: local
```

Launch the containers using:

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Using the Docker Command Line

If you want to run the application manually instead of using `docker-compose`, these are the basic steps you need to run:

1. Create a network

  ```bash
  $ docker network create jenkins-tier
  ```

2. Create volumes for Jenkins persistence and launch the container

  ```bash
  $ docker volume create --name jenkins_data
  $ docker run -d --name jenkins -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --net jenkins-tier \
    --volume jenkins_data:/bitnami/jenkins \
    bitnami/jenkins:latest
  ```

Access your application at http://your-ip/

## Persisting your application

For persistence of the Jenkins deployment, the above examples define a docker volume namely jenkins_data`. The Jenkins application state will persist as long as this volume is not removed.

If avoid inadvertent removal of this volume you can [mount a host directory as data volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/#mount-a-host-directory-as-a-data-volume). Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

### Mount host directories as data volumes with Docker Compose

The following `docker-compose.yml` template demonstrates the use of host directories as data volumes.

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  jenkins:
    image: bitnami/jenkins:latest
    ports:
      - '80:8080'
      - '443:8443'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/jenkins-persistence:/bitnami/jenkins
```

### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

1. Create a network (if it does not exist)

  ```bash
  $ docker network create jenkins-tier
  ```

2. Create the Jenkins the container with host volumes

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d --name jenkins -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --net jenkins-tier \
    --volume /path/to/jenkins-persistence:/bitnami/jenkins \
    bitnami/jenkins:latest
  ```

# Upgrading Jenkins

We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the Jenkins container.

The `bitnami/jenkins:latest` tag always points to the most recent release. To get the most recent release you can simple repull the `latest` tag from the Docker Hub with `docker pull bitnami/jenkins:latest`. However it is recommended to use [tagged versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/jenkins/tags/).

Get the updated image:

```
$ docker pull bitnami/jenkins:latest
```

## Using Docker Compose

1. Stop the running Jenkins container

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose stop jenkins
  ```

2. Remove the stopped container

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose rm jenkins
  ```

3. Launch the updated Jenkins image

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose start jenkins
  ```

## Using Docker command line

1. Stop the running Jenkins container

  ```bash
  $ docker stop jenkins
  ```

2. Remove the stopped container

  ```bash
  $ docker rm jenkins
  ```

3. Launch the updated Jenkins image

  ```bash
  $ docker run -d --name jenkins -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
    --net jenkins-tier \
    --volume jenkins_data:/bitnami/jenkins \
   bitnami/jenkins:latest
  ```

> **NOTE**:
>
> The above command assumes that local docker volumes are in use. Edit the command according to your usage.

# Configuration

## Environment variables

The Jenkins instance can be customized by specifying environment variables on the first run. The following environment values are provided to custom Jenkins:

- `JENKINS_USERNAME`: Jenkins admin username. Default: **user**
- `JENKINS_PASSWORD`: Jenkins admin password. Default: **bitnami**

### Specifying Environment variables using Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  jenkins:
    image: bitnami/jenkins:latest
    ports:
      - '80:8080'
      - '443:8443'
    environment:
      - JENKINS_PASSWORD=my_password
    volumes:
      - jenkins_data:/bitnami/jenkins

volumes:
  jenkins_data:
    driver: local
```

### Specifying Environment variables on the Docker command line

```bash
$ docker run -d --name jenkins -p 80:8080 -p 443:8443 \
  --net jenkins-tier \
  --env JENKINS_PASSWORD=my_password \
  --volume jenkins_data:/bitnami/jenkins \
  bitnami/jenkins:latest
```

# Backing up your application

To backup your application data follow these steps:

## Backing up using Docker Compose

1. Stop the Jenkins container:

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose stop jenkins
  ```

2. Copy the Jenkins data

  ```bash
  $ docker cp $(docker-compose ps -q jenkins):/bitnami/jenkins/ /path/to/backups/jenkins/latest/
  ```

3. Start the Jenkins container

  ```bash
  $ docker-compose start jenkins
  ```

## Backing up using the Docker command line

1. Stop the Jenkins container:

  ```bash
  $ docker stop jenkins
  ```

2. Copy the Jenkins data

  ```bash
  $ docker cp jenkins:/bitnami/jenkins/ /path/to/backups/jenkins/latest/
  ```

3. Start the Jenkins container

  ```bash
  $ docker start jenkins
  ```

# Restoring a backup

To restore your application using backed up data simply mount the folder with Jenkins in the container. See [persisting your application](#persisting-your-application) section for more info.
